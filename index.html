        <h2><strong>The ideia</strong></h2>
        <p>It is incredibly hard to find new music out there, the recommendations algorithms are so well-made that true option is just not there anymore. With that in my mind (and probably some grains of caffeine) I made a Spotify scrapper that extract a good amount of music on a daily basis. This allows people (mostly developers) to search by themself and find new stuff.</p>
        
        <h2>The datasets</h2>
        <p>They are generated daily on this bucket. You can always find the latest one here.<br/>Just beware that since this is a backyard project, there is no standad yet and the format may vary.

        <h2>Let's have some fun</h2>
        
        <p>If you click on the button bellow it will
            <ol>
                <li>Grab the latest dataset</li>
                <li>Ask you to put some target music codes</li>
                <li>Ask how many musics you will want on your playlist</li>
                <li>The hamsters on your computer will do some magic (basic math really)</li>
                <li>Badabin, badabon, a new playlist will appear on your screen</li>
                
            </ol><code>Beware that it make computations on your browser and on really low end machines this may cause the tab to crash</code></p>

        <h2>What we can and what we cannot do</h2>
        <p>This project requires serverside computation, and serverside computation require me paying for it. In order of making it afordable, I'll only go as far as displaying the playlist on the screen. <br/>I have another page ready that creates the playlist on <b>your</b> spotidy account, but that will only happen if this project recieves some donations and it is able to sustain itself.</p>
